In this lab, I learned how to set up a development environment using VS Code and Git.
I practiced initializing a Git repository and connecting it to a remote GitHub repository.
Working with branches taught me how to isolate changes and merge them back safely.
The .gitignore file helped me understand how to exclude unnecessary files from version control.
Overall, this lab gave me a solid foundation for collaborative web development workflows.
